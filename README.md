Day 1: June 1, 2017 - Thursday; 10:08PM

Today's Progress: I started out today with the FreeCode Camp Portfolio Challenge (Build a Random Quote Machine) 
                  I have been able to create the html and stylesheets. Would continue tomorrow by attempting to write the Jquery bit of                     the challenge. 
                  
Thoughts: Interesting. Feels very good to cancel off Day 1 as completed on my Calendar.  :) #99DaysLeft
