#Day 1: June 1, 2017 - Thursday; 10:08PM

Today's Progress: I started out today with the FreeCode Camp Portfolio Challenge (Build a Random Quote Machine) 
                  I have been able to create the html and stylesheets. Would continue tomorrow by attempting to write the Jquery bit of                     the challenge. 
                  
Thoughts: Interesting. Feels very good to cancel off Day 1 as completed on my Calendar.  :) #99DaysLeft


#Day 2: June 2, 2017 - Friday; 10:00PM

Today's Progress: Continued working on the Random Quote Machine. Having issues with CORS. I am able to reach some domains serving quote APIs but when I make the calls I get an error response regarding cross origin header set to null

Thoughts: Interesting. Feels annoyed with the CORS challenge but also very good to cancel off Day 2 as completed on my Calendar.  :) #98DaysLeft

#Day 3: June 3, 2017 - Saturday; 10:00PM

Today's Progress: Been at it since morning. Continued working on the Random Quote Machine Challenge. Was finally able to fix the CORS challenge with an AJAX call and passing the right parameters. Now to face the tasks of changing the background colors with each new quote click. will tackle that tomorrow

Thoughts: Interesting. The web development domain is verse, need to read more. Relieved to cancel off Day 3 as completed on my Calendar.  :) #97DaysLeft

#Day 4: June 4, 2017 - Sunday; 10:00PM

Today's Progress: Came back from church tired, twas a long service. However, I was able to tackle the background color change with each button click. was also able to insert the twitter and facebook icons too and have them change to the background color at each click. 
New challenge discovered: having issues getting the tweet fa-icon to post tweets. Must I use the default Tweeter button. will continue tomorrow joor o.

Thoughts: Felt frustrated with the tweeter button and had to go chill out. Today as yesterday felt rather 'Relieved' than excited to cancel off Day 4 as completed on my Calendar.  :) #96DaysLeft

#Day 5: June 5, 2017 - Monday; 11:30PM

Today's Progress: Finally figured out how to fulfill the userstory of posting the quotes of a random quote machine to twitter. Thanks to Stephen Mayeus@ESLhiphop for demonstrating a simple way. Cant believe i have searched all past weekend of how to make this happen. With this I close out on the FCC Random Quote Machine challenge
